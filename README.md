# Welcome to Surviv+! 😃 (im probabaly deleting this project i dony hack anymore if you want check my YT SCAR-H YT)

This is a Surviv.io mod loaded as a Chrome extension. It was originally developed by [davids coding] [reuke] and [kalabrative] but since they all have been away, I have decided to take ownership of the development of the code. 

It works by modifying the JS files sent from the server to the client, and adds scripts to enhance the user experience.

## 👋 Final Words from SCAR-H YT

Big thanks to [reuke] he started everything and created an amazing foundation for me to learn from. Although time consuming, this project was very fun to work on, because i got to apply my ideas in a game, while self learning the JS language. 

Anyway, this will be end of development and will be the final copy. This is what [davids coding] said but im going to continiue to develop this code.
