# Welcome to Surviv+! ðŸ˜ƒ

This is a Surviv.io mod loaded as a Chrome extension. It was originally developed by [reuke](https://github.com/reuke), transferred to [Kalaborative](https://github.com/Kalaborative) but since both have been away, I have decided to take ownership of the development of the code. 

It works by modifying the JS files sent from the server to the client, and adds scripts to enhance the user experience. 

If you like this project, and want it to last, please consider supporting.

## ðŸ‘‹ Final Words from DavidsCoding

Big thanks to [reuke](https://github.com/reuke), he started everything and created an amazing foundation for me to learn from. Thanks to [Kalaborative](https://github.com/Kalaborative), he helped me learn the ropes even more and helped maintain it when reuke left. Although time consuming, this project was very fun to work on, because I got to apply my ideas in a game, while self learning the JS language. 

Anyway, this will be end of development and will be the final copy. This project will be maintained when the game is updated, but other than that, my work here is done.
